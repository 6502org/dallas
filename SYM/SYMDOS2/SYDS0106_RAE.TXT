                           INTRODUCTION 
 
 
      FDC-1  is  a disk controller for SYM with 4K DOS  on  board. 
 However there are bugs exist in the DOS. Moreover the undeletable 
 file  format is very inconvenient.  The user have to  reformat  a 
 diskette  very  often.  The  design  of the DOS  also  limit  its 
 expansion. Due to the above reasons, I try to write a new DOS for 
 FDC-1 to replace the original one. 
 
      SYMDOS2  replace the original DOS directly.  It can  operate 
 with either 5" or 8" dual drive system.  See FDC-1 manual for the 
 configuration  required.  It can operate up to four  single  side 
 drive  with  little hardware modification.  When using  on  board 
 keyboard,  you  have to change the vectors yourself as if in  the 
 origional DOS. 
 
      SYMDOS2 can operate in as small as 1K system. The default is 
 for 4K system. The diskette format is default as 5" single densty 
 128  bytes/sector  or  5" double denstiy  256  bytes/sector.  See 
 ALTERNATION  for  change  of  defaults.   Diskette  formatted  by 
 original DOS may be used by SYMDOS2. However the directory format 
 is not compatible. 
 
      SYMDOS2 is carefully checked to eliminate bugs.  If any bugs 
 exist, please drop me a note. 
 
      Finally I hope you would like SYMDOS2.

                       FILE NAME FORMAT 
 
      Characters  - ,  " and embedded space should not be used  in 
 all types of file name. Allowable characters are: 
           A-Z       $         +         = 
           a-z       %         /         > 
           0-9       &         : 
           !         (         ; 
           #         )         < 
      In BASIC, : is also an invalid character in filename. 
      
      There are two different file name foramt. 
 
  I.   Similar  to  original  FIO  but file name may be  up  to  11 
       characters long but "." cannot be one of the character. 
 
  II.  There are two types of filename: 
       Type  I is unambiguous file name.  Maxinium length of  file 
       name is 8 but it has a extension of maxinium 3  characters. 
       During input it takes the form: 
             FILENAME.EXT  ("."  will  not be stored as one of  the 
       characters of the file name.) 
 
       Character ? and * are invalid in type I. 
 
       Followings are valid file name: 
          FIO2$1.RAE     FIO2$1.OBJ     LIKEIT.Y/N 
          BOOTSDOS. (equivalent to BOOTSDOS.) 
 
       Followings are invalid: 
          NAMETOOLONG.OBJ     (file name exceed 8 characters) 
          NAMETOOLO.NG 
          SMALL.FORTH         (extension exceed 3 characters) 
       (NAMETOOLONG  is  a  valid file  name  of  Form  I.  However 
       NAMETOOLONG. is invalid) 
 
       Extension  is used to show what kind of program is  it.  For 
       example: 
          .RAE :RAE source listing      .REL :relocatable file 
          .OBJ :object code             .DAT :data file 
          .COM :executable file         .XRF :cross reference listing 
          .BAS :BASIC program           .SWP :SWP files 
          .FOR :FORTH                   .PAS :PASCAL program 
          .PRN :print file 
          .....etc 
 
       Type II is ambiguous file name. File name may contain * and 
       ? but they are not intrepret as characters of file name. 
       e.g.    FILE?1.COM   refer   to   FILE11.COM,    FILE#1.COM 
       ,FILEA1.COM, ...etc. '?' will  match for any character. 
       ????????.??? refer to all files. 
 
 
 
 
                                 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Function of '*' is similar to '?' but it is more  powerful. 
       *.* is same as ????????.??? 
       FILE*.COM is same as FILE????.COM 
       FILE*1.* is same as FILE????.??? (1 is useless) 
 
           This  type of file name should not be used in save  and 
       load command.  It may only be used in directory listing and 
       deleting. 
 
 
 
 
                    DISK DRIVE UNIT ASSIGNMENTS 
 
        UNIT NO.                 ASSIGNMENT 
           0              DRIVE 0 SIDE 1, READ OR WRITE

           5              DRIVE 1 SIDE 1, READ VERIFY AFTER WRITE 
           6              DRIVE 0 SIDE 2, READ VERIFY AFTER WRITE 
           7              DRIVE 1 SIDE 2, READ VERIFY AFTER WRITE 
 
 
 
 
 OPERATION WITH SUPERMON 
 
      A  terminal must be used in using SYMDOS2.  Every time after 
 reset, you should link SUPERMON with SYMDOS2 by: 
      .G 9006 <cr> 
 
      There are four commands for disk operation. They are L3, L7, 
 S3  and S4.  Error message will display as ER nn.  (nn  is  error 
 number.  See  appendix  B for the listing of error  code.  During 
 input of file name,  last character can be deleted by using  RUB, 
 BACK  ARROW(UNDERLINE) OR CTL-H.  Character before '.' cannot  be 
 deleted. 
 
 
 Command L3: This command is for loading a saved file into memory. 
             Going  to the start address immediately after loading 
             can be chosen as option. See the following additional 
             unit assignment. 
 
 
           80             DRIVE 0 SIDE 1, GO ST. ADDRS AFTER READ 
           81             DRIVE 1 SIDE 1, GO ST. ADDRS AFTER READ 
           82             DRIVE 0 SIDE 2, GO ST. ADDRS AFTER READ 
           83             DRIVE 1 SIDE 2, GO ST. ADDRS AFTER READ 
 
   
 
 
                                 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   Type I: .L3<cr> 
           filename,u<cr>      filename must be unambiguous 
                               u is unit number 
      This  command  loads the file into the  same  location  from 
    which it was originally saved. 
 
  Type II:.L3<cr> 
          filename,u,sa<cr>    filename must be unambiguous 
                               u is unit number 
                               sa  is the starting address of  the 
                               file to be loaded 
      This  command allows the loading of the file into  different 
    location. 
 
   Data loaded from the disk must be in whole number of sectors. 
 
 Command L7: It  will  list  all  or some selected  files  on  the 
             diskette  to  the  display.  There  are  two  listing 
             formats. They are as follow: 
             filenameEXT :filenameEXT : ...... 
             Default  is  6  directories per line for  80  columns 
             terminal. 
        OR   filenameEXT ssss-eeee:filenameEXT ssss-eeee:..... 
             This kind of format can be selected by setting bit  7 
             of DIR/LIN in ID sector to 1.  The no. of directories 
             per line is indicate in the lower 7 bits.  $82  means 
             that there are 3 directories per line. 
  Type I :.L7 u<cr> 
    It  will list all the files on the diskette in the drive  with 
    unit number u. 
 
  Type II:.L7 <cr> 
          filename,u<cr>       filename can be ambiguous 
    It  will  only  list  the  file(s)  which  are  referenced  by 
    filename.  filename of *.* will list all the files. 
 
 NOTE: If  you want to select the directory format other than that 
       selected in the ID sector. You may do as follow: 
       (1)  Change DIR/LIN in memory to you  desired  value.  e.g. 
       $82, $05 etc. 
       (2)  L7 80<cr> (or 80+your desire drive unit no.) 
       During these operation. No SETPARMS will be done. 
 
 Command S0: This is a rename command. Command format is: 
             S0<cr> 
             new filename,old filename,drive unit no. 
             The  file  with old file name in the specified  drive 
             will change to the new file name. 
 
 Command S3: This is SAVE command.  When execute this command, the 
             DOS will first delete file with the same file name on 
             the diskette if any.  Make sure that different  files 
             do not have same file name before saving. 
 
           .S3<cr> 
 
 
                                 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           filename,u,sa,ea<cr>     filename must be unambiguous 
                                    u is drive unit number 
                                    sa is starting address 
                                    ea is ending address 
 
    Whole number of sectors of data will be saved on the  diskette 
  and  some  extra  data  will  be transfered  to  memory  in  the 
  subsequent loads. 
 
 
 Command S4: This  command is used to delete unwanted  file(s)  on 
             the  diskette.  This command is very powerful and  so 
             very dangerous. This command can delete ALL the files 
             on the diskette. Be careful when using this command. 
 
           .S4<cr> 
           filename,u<cr>           filename can be ambiguous 
                                    u is drive unit number 
    e.g.   .S4<cr> 
           *.*,0<cr>   will delete all files on the diskette.

 OPERATION WITH BASIC 
 
    By executing X=USR(&"9000",0)<cr>, BAS-1 will link to SYMDOS2. 
 The  memory upper limit of BAS-1 is not set during log on.  There 
 are two disk command in BASIC. They are LOAD and SAVE. 
 
 LOAD  u:"filename"<cr> will load the file 'filename'  from  drive 
 with  unit  number  u into memory.  If size  of  the  program  is 
 greater than the available memory space, ER 0F will be printed. 
 LOAD   u:A,"filename"<cr>  will  append the file with  file  name 
 'filename'  to  the end of the program in memory.  If  is  user's 
 responsibility  to make sure that the two program have  different 
 line number and proper line number sequence. 
 
 SAVE u:"filename"<cr> will save the file to the diskette. 
 
 filename in SAVE and LOAD command must be unambiguous. 
 
 Error message will be displayed as nn BAD LOAD or nn BAD SAVE. nn 
 is error code. 
 
 SYMDOS2  do not provide command for exiting to monitor in  BASIC. 
 Since  BAS-1 do not link to SYMDOS2 through  INVEC,  so  terminal 
 control patch may be used and most terminal control patch provide 
 the command for exiting to SUPERMON. 
 
 
 
 OPERATION WITH RAE 
 
      By entering: 
         >RU $9003<cr> 
 RAE  will  link to SYMDOS2 and it will have  the  following  disk 
 function: EN, LO ,DC and continue to disk. 
 
 Command ENter: This is a save command. The format is, 
           >EN filename u<cr> 
 
 Command LOad: This  is  a load  command.  It can load  file  into 
               memory or append file from the diskette. 
           >LO filename u<cr> load file into memory 
           >LO filename u A<cr> append  file from the diskette  to 
                                the file in the memory. 
 
 Command DC Dir: executing  this command will print the  directory 
                 of the diskette on the termianl. 
            >DC Dir u<cr>  list all files. 
            >DC Dir filename u<cr> list some selected files. 
                (see the use of L7 in OPERATION of SUPERMON) 
 
 Command DC Kill: This command is to kill files on the diskette. 
            >DC  Kill  filename u<cr>  delete the  file  from  the 
                                       directory.
