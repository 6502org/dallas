<p>This page describes a EPROM programmer that is designed to operate on a SYM-1
computer.&nbsp; this board is named 2716/2532 Board because it will program
either of these memory types.&nbsp; Each chip type has its own programming
software.</p>
<p>The hardware is built on a Radio Shack project board catalog number
276-154.&nbsp; Here is a&nbsp; <a href="2716-2532%20photo.htm">photo</a> of the
completed board.&nbsp; The <a href="2532sch.PDF">schematic</a> shows the wiring
diagram of the board.&nbsp; Note that one of the onboard buffer transistors is
wired as shown on the SYM.&nbsp; This could be moved onto the programmer board
rather than use the&nbsp; buffer transistor on the SYM.</p>
<p>This board was designed originally to program 2716 EPROM's and later software
was written to allow 2532 types to be programmed as well.&nbsp; My original 2716
design was published in EDN magazine September 2, 1981 page 259 &quot;Simple
programmer handles 2716 EPROM's, Dallas Shell, Rockwell International.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="E2532%20RAE.TXT">source code</a> for programming 2532
EPROM's.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="E2532%20OBJ%20PTAPE.TXT">object code</a> in
SYM paper tape format that is loaded into memory and executed to program the
2532.</p>
