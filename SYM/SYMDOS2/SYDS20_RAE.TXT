                            APPENDIX F 
                      ASSEMBLE OF FORMAT.RAE 
 
      Assembling  of  FORMAT.RAE in the normal way will give  many 
 labels  undefined  error.  It is because all  addresses  of  DDI2 
 referenced by FORMAT.RAE has not been defined. 
 
      Now,  I  want to introduce a method of linking FORMAT.RAE to 
 DDI2. We will required two source files FORMAT.RAE and DDI2.RAE. 
 
 1) Load  DDI2.RAE  into  TEXT  buffer.   Add  the  line   .CT<cr> 
    immediately  before the line .EN .   Change the .BA address if 
    required to reflex the actual address of DDI". 
 2) Then assemble DDI2.RAE for pass 1 only. i.e. type 
      >ASseble 
 3) When the message 'READY FOR PASs 2' is prined.  DON'T TYPE  PA 
    to complete pass 2. 
 4) Type  SEt  to see the address of the end of label  buffer.  We 
    should see the following: 
       aaaa-bbbb cccc-dddd eeee 
       ffff  gggg 
 5) Now type: 
    >SE $aaaa $bbbb $gggg<cr>    [REM it is $gggg] 
    but you should remember the value of cccc 
    This step is to change the starting address of label buffer to 
    the end of the label buffer of last assembly. 
 6) Then LOad FORMAT.RAE into TEXT buffer. Add the line .CT before 
    the line .EN 
 7) Type ASsemble to assemble for pass 1 only 
 8) When the message 'READY FOR PASS2' is printed.  Type : 
    >SE $aaaa $bbbb $cccc 
    (aaaa, bbbb and cccc are values appeared in step 4) 
 9) Now type PAss2 to complete the assemble. 
 
 
 
 ( If you only have the label file of DDI2.RAE, load it into label 
 buffer  and  set the start of the label buffer to the end of  the 
 label file of DDI2.RAE.  Moreover skip step 1 to 5. Value cccc is 
 the starting address of the label file of DDI2.RAE. 
 The label file of DDI2.RAE should have the file name DDI2.LAB   )
