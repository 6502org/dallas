<title>This page describes a EPROM Programmer for 2708 type EPROMS</title>
</head>

<p>This page describes a EPROM programmer that is designed to operate on a SYM-1
computer.&nbsp; this board is named 2708 Board because it will program&nbsp; these memory types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hardware is built on a Radio Shack project board catalog number
276-154.&nbsp; Here is a&nbsp; <a href="photo_of_2708.htm">photo</a> of the
completed board.&nbsp; The <a href="2708%20sch.PDF">schematic</a> shows the wiring
diagram of the board.&nbsp;Note the transistior switching arangement was
designed to meet the source and sink requirement of the 2708.&nbsp; Later model
chips did not have this unusual requirement.</p>
<p>The external voltage supplied to the Programmer should be 27.3 volts to
maintain the chips required voltage during programming based on the switching
circuit shown.&nbsp;&nbsp; This voltage was generated using a LM 723 regulator
adjusted to 27.3 volts.</p>
<p>This project was designed and built in 1982 long before I had an assembler
program, so all of the code was hand assembled and keyed into the SYM from a
Teletype Terminal.&nbsp; The source code is avaliable in printed form and the
object code is on cassette tape.&nbsp; Design notes of the timing pulse and
power supply are also avaliable if needed.</p>
<p>I have not included the additional information due to the obscurity of the
2708 EPROM these days.&nbsp; If it is required, I can supply all other aspects
of this project.</p>
