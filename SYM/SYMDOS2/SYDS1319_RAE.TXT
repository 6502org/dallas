                   USING FORMAT UTILITY PROGRAM 
 
 
      Enter the format program by typing: 
           .L3<cr> 
           FORMAT.COM,80<cr> 
 
 
      Now there is two function only,FORMAT AND QUIT. 
 
 FORMAT:  message  will  display to ask for  unit  no.,density,and 
          sector length.  Unit no. is same as that in SYMDOS2. The 
          density  code  is  0 for single and 1  for  double.  The 
          sector length code is 0 for 128,  1 for 256,  2 for  512 
          and 3 for 1024. There is no defaults. 
          (The  parameters  defaulted in SYMDOS2 is  for  diskette 
          formatted as double density 256 bytes/sector) 
 
 QUIT  :  quit to the calling program. Usually is the SUPERMON. 
 
 
 
      See  appendix  F  to see how to  assemble  FORMAT.RAE  after 
 modification(s).

                SOME POSSIBLE HARDWARE MODIFICATION 
 
      Two  hardware modification of FDC-1 is supported by SYMDOS2. 
 The modification and required change in FDC-1 is described below: 
 
 1)Hardware:The  motor  of the drive will turn on only  when  both 
            motor  on is low and drive is selected.  Therefore  at 
            most one motor will be on at the same time.  This  can 
            save power. 
   Software:Change bit 1 of FFLAGS to 1. 
 
 2)Hardware:Delay  in  drive deselect.  When this modification  is 
            made.  Then after every disk operation (e.g. sector(s) 
            read),  the drive may be deselect softwarely and  need 
            not  consider whether this is any more disk  operation 
            follow.  A  mono-stable should be inserted between the 
            jumper 5. 
   Software:Change bit 0 of FFLAGS TO 1.

 [Unless otherwise  specified,  the below routines  will  indicate 
 error  by setting carry flag to 1 on return and the error code is 
 in the accumulator A] 
 SP.LDX         SETPARMS and then go LOADX 
 LOADX          Load  file into memory with filename in WRKBUF-$28 
                (i.e.  FCB).  If PARNR=2,  start  address=P3H,P3L. 
                Otherwise file is loaded where it is save. 
 OFF            Turn off the motor and deselect all drives. 
 SP.SVX         SETPARMS and then go SAVEX. 
 SAVEX          Save  file  on to diskette with filename  in  FCB. 
                Start  and end address is in P1H,P1L  and  P2H,P2L 
                respectively.  Any  file  with same file  name  is 
                deleted previous the saving. 
 SP.DEL         SETPARMS and then go DEL 
 DEL            delete  the file(s) with file name in  FCB.  Drive 
                number is in IDISK.  If C=0,Z=1,  this indicate no 
                this  file present.  If C=0,Z=0,  then it indicate 
                the file(s) is/are successfully deleted. 
 SP.REN         SETPARMS and then go RENAME 
 RENAME         Rename  the file with file name in FCB to the  new 
                file name in FCB+$10. 
 SP.DIR1        SETPARMS if bit 6 of UFLAGS is not =1 and then  go 
                DIR.FM1. 
 DIR.FM1        List all files in drive IDISK. 
 SP.DIR2        SETPARMS  if bit 6 of UFLAGS is not =1 and then go 
                DIR.FM2 
 DIR.FM2        Directory listing some selected file referenced by 
                the file name (may be unambiguous) in FCB 
 GETDTA         Get file name and other parameters from the input. 
                Filename  is  stored  in FCB  and  parameters  are 
                stored in P3L-P1H. 
 GETNAM         Get file name from input.

                no. bit 1=side no. 
 SETPARMS       Set  up necessary parameters.  Read parameters  of 
                the diskette into memory if ID sector present.  It 
                should be called before every disk operation.

 OPEN           Open file with file name in FCB.  i.e.  search for 
                the file with file name in FCB

                also unambiguous file name type) 
 CHKIV          Check  for  ?  and * and indicate error if one  or 
                more of them is present. 
 BEFLOAD        Open the file and move start and end address  into 
                P3H-P2L.   If   relocation   option  is   selected  
                (PARNR=2),  then  start address is assumed  to  be
