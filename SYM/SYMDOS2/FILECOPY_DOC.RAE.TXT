                          FILECOPY V1.0
 
     FILECOPY is used to copy files between different diskette. Copying
files of size greater than available memory is possible. However you
cannot copy file(s) onto the same side of the diskette.
 
     Below is an example use of FILECOPY:
.L3
FILECOPY.COM,80       ;assume FILECOPY is present
 
FILECOPY V1.0
filename,source unit,dest. unit(,HIMEM) -> FILECOPY.*,0,1    ;HIMEM is opt.
copying -> FILECOPYRAE
copying -> FILECOPYCOM
copying -> FILECOPYDOC    ;above files are just examples
 
     Buffer for FILECOPY begin immediately after the program. If the
third parameter is not given, it is default as (WRKBUF)-$100 (i.e. 
the address of the sector buffer of SYMDOS2-$100 ). Usually WRKBUF will
set near to the top of available memory. Therefore, by default, FILECOPY
will use nearly all the available memory as buffer. However, in the
present version of FILECOPY, file can only be copied at most one at a time.
Therefore if the file size is smaller than the buffer size, not all of the
buffer will be used.
 
     FILECOPY can be used to transfer files between diskettes of different
sector size and block size. To achieve this, buffer size is adjusted so tha
the size is integral number of K-bytes. Hence the buffer size must be at
least 1K otherwise you will get the error message "Not sufficient memory"
 
     If you have some data in memory and you don't want to overwritten
them when FILECOPY is run, you may specific the top address of the
memory available to FILECOPY plus one. FILECOPY will not use memoey 
above that address but it is not necessary the FILECOPY use all the
memory available to it. For example the RAE text buffer begin at $2000,
you may given $2000 as the third parameter to the FILECOPY.
 
filename,source unit,dest. unit(,HIMEM) -> FILECOPY.COM,0,1,2000
 
     If you have only one drive (single or double side), and you want
to copy file to different diskette, you can still use this program.
If the source and dest. unit is the same drive (e.g. unit 0 and 2 refer
to the same drive but different side), FILECOPY will ask you to insert
the source diskette and destination diskette at suitable time. If you
really want to copy file from one side to the other side of the drive
you may $80 to source unit OR destination unit. Below are some examples:
 
FILECOPY V1.0
filename,source unit,dest. unit(,HIMEM) -> FILECOPY.COM,0,0,2000
 
Put in SOURCE diskette then press RETURN
copying -> FILECOPYCOM
Put in DEST.  diskette then press RETURN
 
 
FILECOPY V1.0
filename,source unit,dest. unit(,HIMEM) -> FILECOPY.COM,0,82
copying -> FILECOPYCOM
