 OPERATION WITH DDI (DISK DRIVE INTERFACE) 
 
      Only  read/write  sector  will be discussed  here.  The  DDI 
 parameter control block is located at $A600-$A605. 
      $A600     drive number (00 or 01) 
      $A601     track number,most sigificant bit indicate side no. 
      $A602     sector number (01 to max. no. of sector) 
      $A603     lower byte of the transfer address 
      $A604     higher byte of the transfer address 
      $A605     IFLAG, setting to 00 will turn off the drive after 
                read/write.  If  the verify bit of IFLAG is set to 
                1,  then  before every disk operation,  track  no. 
                will be verified.  (In origional DOS, track no. is 
                veified only when ITRACK not equal to CURTRK) 
 
      After setting the above parameters,with: 
           .R<cr> 
           P XXXX,<SPACEBAR> 
           S   XX,<SPACEBAR> 
           F   XX,<SPACEBAR> 
           A   XX,04 for read or 05 for write then <cr> 
      Then .G 9800<cr> to read/write the sector. 
 
      NOTE:  When  calling  DDI,  no error message  will  display. 
             Return with carry flag set indicate error has occured 
             and error code is in accumulator. 
 
      The  no.  of  retries  is 3 for seek and  4  for  read/write 
 (include 2 restores).

                        DISKETTE FORMAT 
 
     The  diskette  is divided into a number of blocks  of  memory. 
 Each  block occupy 1 or more sectors.  Each program will at  least 
 occupy 1 block. (see also INTERFACE AND ALTENATION) 
 
    track     sector 
      0         1       ID  sector  for  saving  system  parameter 
                        and/or a small program 
      0       2-end     reserved for future expansion 
      1      1st 3 blks directory storage. 
         (see INTERFACE AND ALTERNATION) 
 
 All other sectors      program files. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                     DIRECTORY FORMAT 
 
     The  following  is a directory entry  format.  Each  directory 
 entry occupy 32 bytes. 
  11 bytes: file name. 
  1  byte : extent number. 
  2  bytes: hex start address. 
  2  bytes: hex end address. 
  16 bytes: block numbers. 
 
     In  one  directory entry,  it can only save 16 block  numbers. 
 Therefore if file size exceed 16 blocks,  another directory  entry 
 will open with extent number equal to 2,3,4..... The extent number 
 may  be  up to $7F.  In directory listing,  only file with  extent 
 number equal 1 will be displayed. 
 
     In a directory entry on diskette, 
 first byte,bit 7 in DD diskette =1 indicate it has be used. 
                     SD diskette =0    "     "   "  "   "  . 
 
 second byte,bit 7,both SD & DD   =1 deleted 
                       diskette   =0 file is active. 
 
 third byte,bit 7 =0 normal 
                  =1 hide directory 
 
 fourth byte,bit 7=0 read/write 
                  =1 write protected or read only 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                 8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        SOME HINTS 
 
 
     If you delete a file that you need.  You can only recover  the 
 file  if  you have just delete it by using S4 command or  you  are 
 sure about  the  blocks previously occupied by the  file  and  the 
 directory entry(ies)have not been over-written. 
 
     To  recover the file,  use direct command to DDI to read  the 
 directory  sector which contain the deleted directory  entry(ies) 
 and then set bit 7 of the second byte to zero. Make sure that all 
 extents  have done the same things.  (no need to worry about  the 
 memory map.) 
 
 
 
     In READ VERIFY mode,  if bad sector is detected,  only the bad 
 block will be deleted from the memory map.  A file with file  name 
 BAD-SEGMENT will open occupying the bad block.  But it will not be 
 display during directory listing.

                     INTERFACE AND ALTERNATION 
 
      Below  is  the  description of the  operations  during  cold 
 start. 
 1)   Set up the necessary vectors, such as URCVEC, URCNEW, IRQVEC 
      ...etc. 
 2)   Move  the  default values to appropiate locations  and  make 
      necessary initialization. 
 3)   Get  the  drive  and diskette  information,  such  as  size, 
      density, sector length, sector/track...etc 
 4)   Read  the  second  to eighth byte of track 0 sector  1  into 
      memory  if  first byte equal to IDMARK  ($4B).  These  seven 
      bytes include the buffer start address, sector/block...etc. 
 5)   Read  the  track 0 sector 1 into memory  starting  from  the 
      buffer start address read in the last operation. 
 6)   If  first byte of the sector equal to IDMARK,  then jump  to 
      START  ADDRESS+$10.  If IDMARK do not present,  then it will 
      simply return. 
 
      Every time before cold start ($9000,  $9003 or $9006), it is 
 better to press reset.  Since in initization, URCVEC will move to 
 URCNEW  and  set  URCVEC to point to SYMDOS2,  cold  start  twice 
 without pressing reset will make both URCVEC and URCNEW point  to 
 SYMDOS2. 
 
      In operation 3),the following disk drive parameters are set: 
        STEPRT  $A611     It  store the step period of the  drive, 
                          default is 2, it can be 0 to 3. See 1791 
                          data sheet. 
        FFLAGS  $A612     Bit  7=0  indicate a 8" drive system  is 
                          installed.  Bit 7=1 indicate a 5"  drive 
                          system is installed. 
        DLYTM   $A613     For a 8" drive system, it store the head 
                          load delay time. Delay time is in ms=2 * 
                          (DLYTM). For a 5" drive system, it store 
                          the  motor on time delay.  Delay time is 
                          in ms=4 * (DLYTM).  If two index  cannot 
                          be sample within this period,  the drive 
                          is considered as not ready.  The default 
                          for 8" drive is 17 and 5" drive is 250. 
                          Moreover for 5" drive, after detecting 2 
                          index  pulus,  if the time  between  two 
                          successive   index  is  20ms+/-4%   ,the 
                          drive is also considered as ready. 
        NOTRKS  $A614     default as 77 for 8" drive system and 35 
                          for 5" drive system. 
      The  above values except FFLAGS can be changed by user after 
 cold start.  For example,  change NOTRKS to $28 for a 40 track 5" 
 disk drive. However other values have to change accordingly, e.g. 
 MAXBLK. 
 
 
      The  seven  values read in operation 4) can be set  by  user 
 after cold start.  They may also be changed during cold start  by 
 
 
                                10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 writing an ID sector.  See below for the steps required to set up 
 an  ID sector.  If other diskette is inserted in the drive  after 
 cold  start  and an ID sector is present,  SYMDOS2 will  set  the 
 values below again EXCEPT WRKBUF. 
        WRKBUF  $A609-    it is the buffer start address.  Default 
                $A60A     is  $F00.   However,  SYMDOS2  will  use 
                          memory  in  the  range  (WRKBUF)-$48  to 
                          (WRKBUF)+sector length. 
 NOTE: the meaning of WRKBUF is different in the original DOS  and 
       in SYMDOS2.  It has been described in the above. Don't make 
       mistake when you want to change the default. 
 
        SEC/BLK  $A60B    The  default is 3.  See table below  for 
                          more information. 
        MAX.BLK  $A60C    The default is 203.  See table below for 
                          more information. 
        DMXSEC   $A60D    The  max.  no.  of sector for  directory 
                          storage.   The   default  for   no.   of 
                          directory  block  is 3 and  default  for 
                          SEC/BLK is 3.  Therefore the default for 
                          DMXSEC   is  9  (DMXSEC=SEC/BLK*no.   of 
                          directory  block).  See table below  for 
                          more information. 
        DIRMASK  $A60E    Mask of diretory  for memory map. Change 
                          according  to  the number  of  directory 
                          block.  If  number of directory block is 
                          3, then set the lower 3 bits to zero and 
                          another bit to 1.  i.e.  %11111000.  The 
                          default  is $F8 for 3 directory  blocks. 
                          See  table  below for more  information. 
        DIR/LIN  $A60F    It store the no. of directory listed per 
                          line MINUS 1.  The default is 5,  i.e. 6 
                          directory  listing per line.  It is  set 
                          for 80 column terminal. 
 
 Table below show the recommand sector/block and maxinium number of 
 blocks.

     You  can use larger number of sector per block but  number  of 
 block will be smaller. The formula is : 
 
   no. of block=INT((sector/track)*(no. of track-1)/(sector/block))

 Maxinium number of directory block is 8 and total number of sector 
 for directory must not exceed number of sector per track. 
 
 
 
      The  operation 5) and 6) is very useful in future expansion. 
 It  may be used to load expansion routine from the  diskette  and 
 set  up necessary vectors.  (track 0 sector 2 to end of track  is 
 reserved  for saving future expansion routine.) It do not do  any 
 things now because at $10 of the ID sector contain a return only.
